## Overview
Our team’s goal is to model the naturally occurring algorithmic nature of music and music theory by constructing algorithms of varying sizes. We hope to build up from smaller algorithms such as generating a chord (combination of 3 notes) into building full musical phrases. Once our toolbox of musical algorithms is sufficient, we intend on introducing some deep learning/AI technology to analyze and learn common musical norms then utilize the algorithms we have designed in the creation of entirely automated musical compositions.

This project will use advanced algorithm building techniques to model the complexities of music in a consistent and usable way. It will also have the aforementioned interface with AI to give our algorithms life in the form of actual music.

## System Infrastructure Tools and Technologies

An appropriate selection of tools is incredibly important for the success of a software development team. The first tool we have decided to utilize is Trello which has a Kanban board, allowing us to keep track of our progression as well as outline user stories and individual tasks. We will be implementing a tailored Scrum methodology with many similar scrum events, for example; we will have daily standup meetings to share our individual progress. Python has been selected to be our main language as all team members have some level of proficiency with it. Additionally, the extensive libraries and information that come with choosing Python allows for more focus on project content and less on pure code-base. The tool selected for the team's main communication is Discord with a dedicated channel for daily stand ups to ensure we remain focused and on the right path.

## Project Set-up
* Install `Python`.
* Change your directory to `C:\...\eng4000\`.
* Run the command : `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies.

## Development Practices
* If a new package or library is added, make sure to add updates `requirements.txt` by running the command: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
