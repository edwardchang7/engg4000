"""
This file will be filled with the functions required to extract and save 
rhythmic patterns from an abc file

1. If polyphonic - seperate
2. Get meter and time signature
3. Translate notes in bars into numbers representing note lengths
4. Analyze numbers looking for patterns
5. Cross reference those sections with original music to get actual musical pattern
